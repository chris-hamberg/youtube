You can search videos, and possibly channels by keyword, but it is not possible to search for just keyword, or views. Views is not a valid top level order for the api logic. Search is top level, and it’s results are ordered by view counts. Any name in a query string that is followed by a ‘?’ is the logical hierarchical parent.)",,,no,n/a,type,no

This includes video searches, and channel searches.",,,,,,
